# Welcome to my Repository 

Hi there!

Welcome to my repository of SQL projects. I've been working with SQL for a while now so, I figured to put all my projetcs in one place. 
Honestlty, creating this repository has been a great way for me to improve my skills. By working on new SQL projects and challenges, I've been able to push myself to learn more about the language and become a better coder. Plus, it's actually fun!

So, go ahead, take a look around, and feel free to use any of my queries if they're helpful to you. And if you happen to have any tips or feedback for me, I'm all ears. I'm always looking to improve my skills, so any advice is greatly appreciated.
